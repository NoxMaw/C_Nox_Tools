/**
 * Nox_Strstr - finds a specific char sequence within a string, of size >= siz. Delimits the found word with a null char.
 *
 * @haystack: string
 * @needle: char sequence to look for in string
 * @siz: Minimum size for a match
 *
 * Return: Null if error, needle if found
 *
 * Description: This is an useful filter to catch words of X size
 * within a string. Originally this function was used to filter out
 * words from Nox_Speak, but I believe it might come-in handy for
 * other things.
 * WARNING: needle MUST be an array, last char of needle will get
 * turned into '\0'
