This makes use of the Nox_Rng to and a dictionary found in the file "words" to print random words to stdout.
Since the word generation is random , it is not particularly fast. Woks best for words of 3 to 4 characters.

To call upon Nox_Speak, simply call the function with the following parameters: Nox_Speak(A, B); Both A and B being integers, A is the number of words to generate and B is how many characters each word will have.
